# Session-start subprocess profile

Repeatable evidence for how many subprocesses one session start creates, where they come from, and what the reductions in `bin/fm-proc-lib.sh`, `bin/fm-wake-lib.sh`, `bin/fm-cursor-lib.sh` and `bin/fm-session-lock-lib.sh` actually removed.
The runtime bound those numbers justify is owned by [`../../bin/fm-session-start-bound-lib.sh`](../../bin/fm-session-start-bound-lib.sh), and the port's fixed-here list by [`../windows.md`](../windows.md).
This page records evidence only.

Date: 2026-08-23.
Comparison base: `main` at `6d7dc9a`.
Linux box: WSL2, Linux 6.18.33.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2, 22 cores, bash 5.2.21.
Windows numbers quoted for context were measured separately on Windows 11, Git Bash MINGW64_NT-10.0-26200.

## Why this is measured on Linux

The defect is a Windows one: a subprocess costs about 42 ms under MSYS against about 1 ms here, so the same digest that finishes in seconds on Linux takes over a minute there.
But the *count* is the same on both, and the count is what the code controls, so it is measurable here without a Windows box - and a Linux timing run would say nothing, because the per-fork penalty is the whole effect.
Every number below is a count of process creations, not a timing.

## How the count is taken

`/proc/stat`'s `processes` counter is host-global and this box runs other work: an idle 5 s sample showed 198 forks of ambient noise, which is the same order as the thing being measured.
So the count is taken per process tree with an `LD_PRELOAD` interposer on `fork`, `execve` and `posix_spawn` that appends one line per call with the caller's `/proc/self/cmdline`, giving both a total and its attribution.
It is validated against a known-count program before use:

```console
$ FORKCOUNT_LOG=v.log LD_PRELOAD=./forkcount.so bash -c \
    'for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do /bin/true; done; x=$(/bin/echo hi); : $(/bin/date +%s)'
$ grep -c '^FORK' v.log ; grep -c '^EXEC' v.log
7
7
```

Seven process creations were asked for and seven were counted.

Two measurement rules matter and were both violated by earlier attempts at this:

- The deferred network stage (`bin/fm-startup-network.sh`) is detached and keeps appending to the log after the digest returns, so a count taken immediately is short. Every figure below is taken after the stage settles, and that stage's forks are reported separately because they are concurrent and not on the blocking path.
- Each variant is measured on its **own pristine home** and its own clone checked out as a branch named `main`. Comparing a `git archive` export against a real checkout attributes the worktree-tangle check's `git` calls to the change under test, and comparing two runs against one shared home attributes the first run's one-time migration markers to it. Both mistakes were made and both inflated a delta by tens of forks.
- Run 1 on a fresh home differs from runs 2 and 3, which are identical to the fork. The steady state is what a daily user pays, so it is the figure quoted.

## Blocking-path forks, empty home, steady state

An empty home is the floor: no tasks, no projects, an absent backlog, nothing to reconcile and nothing to sync.

| Variant | Blocking-path forks | Detached network stage | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| `main` at `6d7dc9a` | 1012 | 555 | 1567 |
| after the runtime-bound change | 1016 | 559 | 1575 |
| after the subprocess reductions | 817 | 432 | 1249 |

The bound change costs 4 forks: one `uname` for the platform default and its command substitution.
The reductions remove 199 forks from the blocking path, 19.6%, and 127 more from the concurrent stage, which shares the same libraries.

At the 42 ms measured under MSYS, 199 forks is about 8 s off a 72 s floor.
That is a real improvement and it is not a fix on its own, which is why the bound was raised as well.

## Where the forks were, ranked

Attribution came from a second, independent instrument: `bash` xtrace with `PS4` carrying `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` and `${LINENO}`, inherited by every child through `SHELLOPTS=xtrace` and a `BASH_XTRACEFD` the children inherit.
The two instruments agree on the total within the noise of the detached stage.

Ranked call sites on `main`, blocking path, steady state:

| Count | Site | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| 69 | `fm-proc-lib.sh` `fm_proc_field`'s `ps` fallback | one `ps` per process field read |
| 41 | `fm-proc-lib.sh` prologue `uname -s` | the file was sourced 42 times per session start |
| 42 | `fm-wake-lib.sh` `fm_lock_link_owner`'s `readlink` | 3 per lock acquisition, 14 acquisitions |
| 24 + 24 | `fm-session-lock-lib.sh` `basename` and `grep -qE` in the harness classifier | once per process while walking ancestry |
| 21 | `fm-session-lock-lib.sh` `fm_proc_field ... \| tr -d ' '` | a subshell plus a `tr` exec per ancestry step |
| 21 | `fm-cursor-lib.sh` `basename` in its process classifier | once per candidate process |
| ~12 each | `fm-wake-lib.sh` prologue `dirname`, `uname`, `mkdir -p` | the file was sourced 13 times per session start |

The dominant pattern was not one hot loop.
It was **libraries re-sourced from inside functions**, each re-running a prologue: 158 library source events per session start, `bin/fm-proc-lib.sh` alone 42 times, each paying its own `uname`.
That is not what the task expected to find and it is where the largest single win was.

One trap this file exists to record: `grep -c uname bin/fm-lock.sh` returns 0, and `bin/fm-lock.sh` forks `uname` four times.
The forks come from libraries it sources. A count derived from grepping source text is a hypothesis about a call site, never a measurement of a call.

## Which substitutions are actually free

Counted, 100 iterations each, same instrument:

| Form | Forks per call |
|---|---|
| `x=$(cat f)` | 1 fork + 1 exec |
| `x=$(<f)` | 0 |
| `read -r x < f` | 0 |
| `x=$(dirname /a/b)` | 1 fork + 1 exec |
| `x=${p%/*}` | 0 |
| `x=$(basename /a/b)` | 1 fork + 1 exec |
| `x=${p##*/}` | 0 |
| `x=$(printf hi)` | 1 fork, 0 exec |

Two results decide how the reductions are written.
A command substitution forks even around a shell builtin, so `$(...)` is never free.
And `$(<f)` is free only *without* a redirection on it: `$(<f 2>/dev/null)` measured 2 forks per call, because the redirection defeats bash's special case, and it does not suppress the error either.
So an unreadable file is handled by testing `[ -r f ]` first - a builtin - rather than by redirecting stderr.

## On the Windows box itself

The count above is portable; these are the numbers from the platform the defect lives on.
Windows 11 build 10.0.26200, `MINGW64_NT-10.0-26200`, bash 5.2.37, git 2.50.1.windows.1, both trees exported to `C:` and driven through one hidden `powershell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -WindowStyle Hidden` invocation per batch.

The per-platform default resolves as intended there, which no Linux run can show:

```console
$ . bin/fm-session-start-bound-lib.sh
$ fm_session_start_default_budget      ; # 300
$ fm_session_start_resolve_budget ''   ; # 300
$ fm_session_start_resolve_budget 45   ; # 45
$ fm_session_start_resolve_budget abc  ; # 300
```

Elapsed on an empty home, steady state: 74 s before, 64-70 s after.
That is directional only, not a precise figure - other work was running on the box during these runs, and it is the reason the fork count rather than a stopwatch is the measurement of record.
All ten sections are present in the completed digest after the change and `SUPERVISION INSTRUCTIONS` is absent before it, which is what that stage's missing header looked like in practice.

The attribution is what changed most visibly. At a 40 s bound, before:

```
●  It stopped during the "lock" stage, so everything above is COMPLETE
●    lock bootstrap wake-queue supervision-instructions read-once fleet-state network-checks context next-step
```

and after:

```
●  Where the time went, per stage (ms), so the slow stage is named:
●    startup                  start=+0       elapsed=9898
●    lock                     start=+9898    elapsed=30102  <- did not finish
```

That `startup` figure is the finding this instrumentation paid for immediately.
It is this script's own setup - one harness probe, seven library sources and the tasks-axi compatibility probe - and it costs **9.9 s on Windows against 312 ms on Linux**, a factor of 32.
Before the `startup` stage existed, a truncation inside that window could only report the stage as `unknown` and list no lost stages at all, which is the case where the banner explains least.
The final stage's elapsed is bounded by the remaining budget rather than measured, because the child was killed inside it; it is a lower bound on that stage, which is why it is marked as not finished.

## Reproducing

```console
$ gcc -shared -fPIC -O2 -Wall -o forkcount.so forkcount.c -ldl
$ git clone --no-hardlinks <repo> r && git -C r checkout -B main <ref>
$ mkdir -p h/data h/state h/config h/projects
$ for i in 1 2 3; do
    FM_HOME=h FORKCOUNT_LOG=forks.$i.log LD_PRELOAD=./forkcount.so \
      bash r/bin/fm-session-start.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
    sleep 8
    printf '%s blocking\n' "$(( $(grep -c '^FORK' forks.$i.log) \
      - $(awk -F'\t' '$1=="FORK" && $2 ~ /fm-startup-network/' forks.$i.log | wc -l) ))"
  done
```

Runs 2 and 3 are the steady-state figure.
The interposer is 60 lines and is not committed; it interposes `fork`, `execve` and `posix_spawn`, appends `kind<TAB>caller-cmdline<TAB>target`, and must include `<stdlib.h>` - an implicit `getenv` returns `int` and truncates the pointer on 64-bit, which silently disables logging.
