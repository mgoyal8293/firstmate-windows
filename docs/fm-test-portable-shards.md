# Firstmate portable test shards

`bin/fm-test-run.sh` owns portable lane composition and execution.
`bin/fm-test-isolation-proof.sh` owns the proven-isolated candidate set.

## Verification inputs

The current candidate timings came from the 2026-07-29 concurrent proof recorded in [fm-test-isolation-proof.md](fm-test-isolation-proof.md).
The proof ran 24 candidates with four workers and no failures.

## Parallel lanes

The two parallel lanes use longest-processing-time assignment from those measured durations.

| Lane | Script count | Estimated duration |
|---|---:|---:|
| `portable-parallel-1` | 11 | 162436 ms (~162.4 s) |
| `portable-parallel-2` | 13 | 162754 ms (~162.8 s) |
| imbalance | | 318 ms |

`bin/fm-test-run.sh` contains the exact ordered memberships in `list_portable_parallel_1` and `list_portable_parallel_2`.

## Portable serial remainder

`portable-serial` includes every `tests/*.test.sh` that is neither proven-isolated nor `real-herdr-gated`.
It keeps watcher, lock, AFK, real tmux, daemon, secondmate lifecycle, bootstrap, live-harness opt-in, GUI-backend, and other unproven work serial.
Membership is derived rather than enumerated, so a newly added test lands here by default.

## Portable serial CI shards

On green CI run [30725985757](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/actions/runs/30725985757), that remainder accumulated 19m04s of script time against a 20-minute job timeout.
On [PR 1495](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/pull/1495), its main step ran about 19m51s before the job was cancelled at that boundary.
`portable-serial-<k>of<n>` splits it across `n` separate CI runners.
Each shard is still strictly serial in itself, and separate runners mean no two of these stateful scripts ever share a machine, so the split needs no concurrency isolation proof.

`bin/fm-test-run.sh` owns `n` and refuses any lane whose `of<n>` disagrees with it.
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` derives the same `n` from `strategy.job-total` rather than a literal, so changing the shard count in either file without the other fails the lane loudly instead of leaving part of the required suite unrun.

Assignment is longest-processing-time bin packing over per-script duration hints embedded in `bin/fm-test-run.sh`.
The hints came from the `fm-test-timing-portable-serial` artifacts of green run [32159215212](https://github.com/mgoyal8293/firstmate-windows/actions/runs/32159215212) on 2026-08-19, where the lane ran 116 scripts in 2539694 ms of serial work.
A script with no hint gets the conservative `PORTABLE_SERIAL_DEFAULT_WEIGHT_MS` default.

Hints affect balance, not coverage: the coverage guard keeps the partition complete and disjoint whatever they say.
Past the job cap, however, a stale hint stops being merely a slower shard.
A shard that overruns `timeout-minutes` is cancelled and reports no verdict at all, which a required check can never turn green and which is indistinguishable from a hang.
That is what happened on 2026-08-19: the table still described a 69-script lane while the lane had grown to 116 scripts and 43 minutes, 46 of the selected scripts had no hint and were packed at the flat default - including the longest script in the lane at 185 s - and packing believed all four shards were 8.5 minutes while the measured spread was 7.7 to 14.7 minutes.
`bin/fm-test-run.sh --check-coverage` therefore reports `unmeasured_serial=<n>` and names any selected serial script still packed at the default, so the drift is visible in every CI run instead of only surfacing as a cancelled job.

| Lane | Script count | Estimated duration |
|---|---:|---:|
| `portable-serial-1of4` | 30 | 634929 ms (~10.58 min) |
| `portable-serial-2of4` | 30 | 634931 ms (~10.58 min) |
| `portable-serial-3of4` | 30 | 634917 ms (~10.58 min) |
| `portable-serial-4of4` | 26 | 634917 ms (~10.58 min) |
| imbalance | | 14 ms |

The single longest script, `tests/fm-pr-check-security.test.sh` at 236511 ms, is the floor for any shard count.

Refresh the hints by downloading the per-shard timing artifacts from a green CI run, replacing the `portable_serial_weight_hints` table in `bin/fm-test-run.sh` with the measured `path`/`duration_ms` pairs, and updating the table above:

```sh
gh run download <run-id> -R kunchenguid/firstmate --pattern 'fm-test-timing-portable-serial-*' -D /tmp/fm-serial
jq -r '.scripts[] | [.path, .duration_ms] | @tsv' /tmp/fm-serial/*.json | LC_ALL=C sort
bin/fm-test-run.sh --check-coverage
```

Refresh from a green run, because a lane that failed part-way records a truncated duration for the script that failed.
Refresh whenever `--check-coverage` reports a non-zero `unmeasured_serial`, and whenever the lane's own growth has outpaced the table.

## Coverage guard

`bin/fm-test-run.sh --check-coverage` verifies that both parallel lanes partition the proven-isolated set.
It also verifies that the parallel lanes, portable serial lane, and real-Herdr family are disjoint and cover every `tests/*.test.sh` script.
It separately verifies that the portable serial CI shards are non-empty, disjoint, and together equal the portable serial lane.
It reports, rather than refuses, `unmeasured_serial=<n>` and the names behind it: a newly added test legitimately has no measured duration until it has run once, but an unmeasured script is packed as if it were average, and enough of them unbalance a shard.

## Timing artifacts

Portable shards, each portable serial shard, and the Herdr lane upload runner-generated timing JSON.
`bin/fm-test-run.sh --aggregate-json` creates the combined summary artifact.
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` owns the exact artifact names and aggregation wiring.

## Local entry points

[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) owns the local test policy and common entry points.
`bin/fm-test-run.sh --help` owns exact lane names, selection flags, and bounded `--jobs` mechanics.

## Timeouts

| Lane | Bound | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| portable parallel 1/2 | job `timeout-minutes: 10` | The measured shard sums are about three minutes and the timeout is a hang tripwire. |
| portable serial 1-4 | job `timeout-minutes: 15` | Each balanced shard is about 10.6 minutes against measured weights, so the cap is a hang tripwire with roughly 1.4x margin. Refresh the weights, or split the lane further, before that margin is spent. |
| Herdr | family-run step `timeout-minutes: 20`; job `timeout-minutes: 75` backstop | Healthy runs finish around 7 minutes, so the step bound is the hang tripwire (cleanup and timing artifacts still upload) while the job cap stays a last-resort backstop. |

Timeouts are hang tripwires rather than expected healthy durations.
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` owns the exact numbers.
